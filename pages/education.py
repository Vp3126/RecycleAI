    Whether an item is recyclable depends on several factors:
    
    1. **Material composition** - What the item is made of
    2. **Contamination level** - How clean the item is
    3. **Local facilities** - What your area can process
    4. **Market demand** - Whether there's demand for the recycled material
    
    Always check local recycling guidelines as they vary by location.

    1. **Collection** - Items are collected from homes and businesses
    2. **Sorting** - Materials are separated by type (often using AI systems!)
    3. **Processing** - Materials are cleaned and prepared for manufacturing
    4. **Manufacturing** - Recycled materials become new products
    5. **Purchasing** - Consumers buy products made from recycled materials

    Avoid these common mistakes that can contaminate recycling:
    
    - **Wishcycling:** Putting items in recycling hoping they're recyclable
    - **Not cleaning containers:** Food residue can contaminate entire batches
    - **Recycling plastic bags:** These jam sorting machines (return to stores instead)
    - **Including small items:** Items smaller than a credit card fall through sorting machines
    - **Leaving caps on bottles:** Different materials need separate processing

    Remember that recycling is just one part of sustainable waste management:
    
    1. **Reduce:** Best option - avoid creating waste in the first place
    2. **Reuse:** Second best - use items multiple times before discarding
    3. **Recycle:** Third best - process items into new materials
    
    Following this hierarchy maximizes environmental benefits.
